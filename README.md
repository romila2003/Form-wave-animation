## Overview

### The challenge

- To create a animation on the label, where each of the letter of the word (e.g. email and password) are animated so it looks like a wave. The challenge involves HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a new concept that allows you to manipulate the html property within the javascript and turn each letter of a word, into a span. This concept was very interesting and intend to use it in future projects. I also used the email validation concept within this project too.

Javascript - mouseenter and mouseleave:

```javascript

labels.forEach(label => {
    label.innerHTML = label.innerText
        .split("")
        .map((letter, idx) => `<span style="transition-delay:${idx * 50}ms">${letter}</span>` )
        .join("")
});

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I should implement the features/concepts learned over the last few projects and future projects, into practical projects/challenges such as the frontendmentor.io projects.
